First, a binary random sequence is generated as the watermark. Then the N-layer discrete wavelet decomposition of the original image is performed to transform the image into wavelet domain. The corresponding threshold value of each wavelet coefficient is obtained utilizing a visual model, thus the watermark insertion strength can be tuned adaptively. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is robust enough to some image processing operations and JPEG lossy compression.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A DWT digital watermarking technique based on a visual model","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It propagates in the open ocean from its source towards the coastal zone where it interacts with the complex geometries of bays and coastal structures before possibly inundating the coast; damaging infrastructure, carrying debris, and causing erosion and deposition of sediment. To overcome the physical and numerical constraints of the problem this study introduces a two-way coupled multiscale tsunami model combining the shallow water equations with the Reynoldsaveraged Navier-Stokes equations. The shallow water model can simulate wide-scale tsunami propagation and the basic inundation mechanism while the Navier-Stokes model is able to consider complex hydrodynamics upon wave breaking and interaction with structures. The model was verified for solitary wave transformation and breaking on a plane beach. Various offshore wave heights and slopes were tested. The two-way coupling algorithm was found to be sufficiently robust particularly if the local wave height and slope are sufficiently small, and the coupling depths are sufficiently large. In contrast to the Navier-Stokes model the shallow water model could not replicate the rapid rate of shoaling required late in the shoaling process. An equation was derived to determine the location where the shallow water model breaks down and thus the optimal depth for coupling to the Navier-Stokes model. The resulting transformation and breaking characteristics described by the coupled model were compared with theoretical reference shoaling rates, physical experiments and a fully nonlinear potential flow model. Good overall agreement was found with possible improvements to the equations derived from the potential model for certain conditions. In contrast to the potential flow model, a Navier-Stokes model is able to simulate post-breaking turbulent behaviour such as touchdown of the plunging jet and splashup which were qualitatively in good agreement with snapshots from experiments. The coupled model was further investigated through an application to a real-scale tsunami problem on Japan’s Tohoku coast. During the 2011 Tohoku-oki Earthquake Tsunami the 63 m deep Kamaishi Bay offshore tsunami breakwater was partially damaged, but the tsunami height was still attenuated with estimates in the 40-50% range. The coupled model was used to investigate the hydrodynamics around the submerged section of the breakwater during the tsunami. Coupling was mostly robustly achieved due to the large Navier-Stokes domain. As a result, it was found that inundation heights and volume fluxes through the submerged section are not largely affected by the introduction of the Navier-Stokes model into the shallow water one. However, pressures much different to hydrostatic ones develop over the submerged breakwater caissons leading to a pressure force that reaches as low as a factor of safety of 0.77 which likely led to the sliding of the caissons. Due to vertical accelerations over the submerged section, the momentum jet angles downwards to the bed. The effect of this is to induce large horizontal velocities found to be considerably greater than those calculated in the shallow water model in an extended region up to 1.3 km from the breakwater. The resultant bed shear stresses have the potential to cause substantial erosion and deposition of sediment in the bay.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/215503/2/dkogk04132.pdf"],"title":"Two-way Coupled Multiscale Tsunami Modelling from Generation to Coastal Zone Hydrodynamics","doi":"10.14989/doctor.k19677","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.14989/doctor.k19677","venue":""}

Ten of the patients were boys and 3 were girls. The mean age was (17.4 +/- 10.7) days. The mean weight was (3.4 +/- 0.8) kg. All the patients received prostaglandin E(1) infusion to dilate the ductus arteriosus before and during the procedure. Valvuloplasty was performed using a low-profile balloon (2.5 - 4.0 mm in diameter), and then a balloon approximately 1.0-1.2 times the annulus diameter was applied. In patients with pulmonary atresia, the valve was perforated with a radiofrequency wire, and then valvuloplasty was performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwelve patients (92%) were successfully treated with transcatheter intervention. Right ventricular systolic pressure decreased by 50% [from (120.1 +/- 17.0) mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) to (58.8 +/- 7.7) mm Hg, P < 0.001], and the ratio of the right ventricular systolic pressure to systemic systolic pressure decreased by 44% [from (1.6 +/- 0.2) to (0.9 +/- 0.1), P < 0.001]. The right ventricular angiography showed that the pulmonary valves were opened. The ratio of the balloons to annulus were (1.1 +/- 0.1) (the maximal balloon size range from 6 to 12 mm). The procedure lasted for a mean of (127.5 +/- 32.6) minutes. The duration of fluoroscopy was (25.2 +/- 7.2) minutes. Complications occurred in 4 patients (30%). Hemopericardium occurred in 2 patients, hypoxia in 1 patient and supraventricular tachycardia in 1 patient. One (8%) patient died. The follow-up periods were (7.2 +/- 6.4) months. Three patients had moderate to severe residual pulmonary stenosis. One of them underwent a second balloon dilation at 3 months of follow-up. The other two were waiting for the second dilation.

However, lack of correspondence in DFI also leads to ineffective control over the morphing process. In particular, unless the user specifies a dense set of landmarks, it is not even possible to measure the distortion of intermediate shapes during interpolation, let alone control it. To remedy such issues, we introduce an approach for establishing correspondence between the interior of two arbitrary objects, formulated as an optimal mass transport problem with a sparse set of landmarks. This correspondence enables us to compute non-rigid warping functions that better align the source and target objects as well as to incorporate local rigidity constraints to perform as-rigid-aspossible DFI. We demonstrate how our approach helps achieve flexible morphing results with a small number of landmarks.","inCitations":["947588573717f46a8034716059d29f59e9810fdc","f717c84fa6ae8ed42849b4f0da3cbfb680dd9a2d","d6ef1e54a6b00dc4e17a3265d75722cb792a01c4","18c2fcd4a1a77d83691ea892e0709f3a7f2ee367","ad4d25cd4518aff7746a2242925d465000a0776c"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12246","http://gaps-zju.org/mlchai/resources/weng2013rigid.pdf"],"title":"As-Rigid-AsPossible Distance Field Metamorphosis","doi":"10.1111/cgf.12246","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12246","venue":"Comput.

These actions are mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which acts in all target tissues to regulate the expression of genes that are integral to cellular response. Studies over the past decade or more have identified a number of target genes in a myriad of tissues, including the intestine and colon. Recent studies on a genome-wide scale have confirmed and extended old ideas and lead to new concepts as well. In the intestine, the actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its receptor are focused upon calcium and phosphate transport, xenobiotic metabolism, and growth regulation. This latter activity may be relevant to the antitumor effects of the hormone in colorectal cancer. Future studies are designed to further understand the actions of the vitamin D hormone in not only the intestine but also other tissues.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Vitamin D System: Biological and Molecular Actions in the Intestine and Colon","doi":"10.1016/b978-0-12-809954-4.00051-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-809954-4.00051-7","venue":""}

As these applications are most widely used so it is necessary to improve their performance and for this purpose frequency selective surface has been used. In this paper a simplest FSS has been proposed using FR4 (Flame Retardant 4) Epoxy substrate as it is easily available and have dielectric constant 4.4 and tangent loss 0.025. The structure is realized with the help of microwave software that is Computer Simulation Technology Microwave Studio (CST MW studio 2014). The proposed design resonates at frequencies 2.5, 3.5 & 5.5 GHz. Further in this paper parametric analysis has been shown of different parameters that help in obtaining the requisite frequency and polarization performance of the proposed design. The simulated result shows that about 97% of power is reflected by the FSS sheet. The proposed novel filter has advantage of simple structure, miniaturized, wide in bandwidth, polarization independent and insensitive to various angles of incidence. By complementing the designed structure band pass filter can also be design.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A novel reflective frequency selective surface for triple frequency applications","doi":"10.1109/ccaa.2017.8230043","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccaa.2017.8230043","venue":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)"}

Investment costs per cow were higher for pit parlor in new building, $979. Parallel parlors had a higher cost per milking unit, $13,201, and cost per cow, $860, than herringbone, $8944 and $582, respectively. Herringbone parlors were used more hours per day, 10.75, than parallel parlors, 8.84, of similar size. Pit parlors in new buildings were more labor efficient, as measured by cows per worker hour, than stall barns with pipeline or flat parlor or pit parlors in old barns. Herringbone and parallel parlor in new building were similar for cows per hour (82 and 83) and cows per worker hour (41 and 43). Parallel or herringbone parlors in old barns had fewer cows per hour (63 and 58) than parallel or herringbone parlors in new buildings. Survey respondents showed greater satisfaction for time spent milking, physical comfort of milker, and milk quality for parlor types over stall barn with pipeline.

Some of the most important results of investigations into the structure of Cu(II) complexes with nitrogen-substituted alpha-amino acids are summarized, and the role of water molecules that are coordinated in two axial positions of these complexes in the mediation of between-ligand interactions is underlined. UV and circular dichroism spectroscopy are shown to be very convenient for studying and quantifying the thermodynamic and kinetic enantioselectivity phenomena in the complex formation. Polystyrene-based chiral ligand exchange resins served as the first highly selective column packing in the development of enantioselective liquid chromatography. These resins were then followed by more efficient silica bonded monomeric and polymeric HPLC phases. The latter proved to be especially stable in aqueous media at elevated temperatures. Finally, chiral coated ligand exchanging RP phases presented the most inexpensive, but highly efficient and selective phases for the resolution of chelate-forming racemic solutes in LC and TLC. The mechanism of chiral resolution on these last phases involves an essential interaction of both the selector and selectand with the achiral hydrophobic surface. The same is valid for chiral resolutions according to chiral mobile phase techniques. Perspectives on further development of enantioselective LEC are discussed.","inCitations":["4ecca1a685b588e486b645fa4491dc31394a2f03"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"30 years of chiral ligand exchange.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Enantiomer"}

The coupled piezoelectric and semiconducting characteristics of the zinc oxide (ZnO) NW cause an output voltage generation that made it interesting to use as an energy harvesting device in nanoscale. In this paper, the piezoelectric potential distribution in a bent ZnO NW is investigated, numerically. To do this, a three-dimensional finite element simulation of the device is performed and the results are analyzed and discussed. It is found that the output piezoelectric potential, for a constant nanowire length, is decreased as the diameter of ZnO NW increases. Study on the effect of NW diameters shows the potential will remain constant for nanowire with aspect ratio below 15. Further, the NWs are considered with an inclination of 20 degree relative to the substrate to study by applying force in different directions. The latter indicates an improvement on the output piezoelectric potential. The obtained results show that the ZnO NW can be used as a good energy harvester device by considering a suitable diameter, length and with a justified inclination angle.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Numerical Study of the Zinc Oxide Nanowire Geometry Effect on Nanogenerator Output","doi":"10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.829.222","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net%2Famr.829.222","venue":""}

Therefore, 100 topsoil samples (0-30 cm) were collected from different regions, FC and PWP (hardly available soil properties), as well as the clay content, silt, sand, carbonate calcium, organic matter content, and gypsum (easily available soil properties) were measured. The PTFs were developed using ANN and were evaluated by determination coefficient (R) and mean square error (MSE). The results revealed that ANN method could predict FC and PWP with more accuracy than MLR. Predictions FC using ANN had R and MSE as 0.64 and 0.01 and For PWP 0.65 and 0.08 respectively. While the respective values obtained from MLR for FC as 0.31 and 0.005 for PWP 0.55 and 0.006, respectively.

After 1995, the introduction of cleaning devices at the ŠTPP dramatically reduced the former extremely high SO2 and dust emissions. The most significant findings of this comprehensive, long-duration survey are as follows: (1) the chosen parameters are suitable bioindicators of stress caused by air pollution in Norway spruce needles; they reflect both spatial and temporal variations in air pollution as well as the degree of efficiency of the cleaning devices; (2) observations show that the physiological condition of Norway spruce in northern Slovenia has significantly improved since 1995, when the first desulphurization device at ŠTPP was built, together with a reduction in the area influenced by pollution from ŠTPP; (3) metabolic processes in spruce needles react to air pollution according to the severity of the pollution and the length of exposure; exposure to high SO2 ambient levels and/or spread over a long duration can damage the antioxidant defence mechanisms of spruce trees as well as diminishing the concentration of ascorbic acid; (4) a reduction in the exposure to air pollution improves the vitality of the trees (e.g. higher concentrations of total (a + b) chlorophyll), as well as restoring their defence capabilities as shown by higher concentrations of ascorbic acid; and (5) forest monitoring should be continued and focused on integrating the effects of multiple stressors, which can additionally affect a forest ecosystem.","inCitations":["e5fa138c3549a3871acb2d5308f967086584e0e5","3d299400849364b20de317824fdc1ce707bcf566","71fc41254515991a682621139aef810103a59f8b","aa3f8d2f2c7248aa7ce041d1aa59ba6fb217f580"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Forest biomonitoring of the largest Slovene thermal power plant with respect to reduction of air pollution","doi":"10.1007/s10661-012-2669-y","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2669-y","venue":""}

Measurements of the polarization parameter for the reaction pi /sup -/p yields pi /sup o/n were made at the five momenta 1.03, 1.245, 1.44, 1.5 and 1.79 GeV/c. A polarized target was used, with polarizations achieved ranging from 48 to 57%. Salient features of the experiment were the use of neutron counters for time-of-flight measurements as well as angular information and the use of optical spark chambers, seven to eight radiation lengths thick, for the detection of the gamma rays from the decay of the pi /sup o/. The center-ofmass angular range covered by the 20 neutron counters was typically --.78 < cos THETA /sub c.m. <.87. For each momentum there are approximately 10,000 events which fit pi /sup -/p yields pi /sup o/ n with a confide nce level of at least 10%.

The 71-kDa protein, which had an isoelectric point of 4.25, was digested into eight major bands at 48 h using trypsin and pepsin at equal enzyme to protein ratios (pH 5.5). The in vitro lymphocyte reactivity of individual peptides suggested P1, P2 and P5 to be significantly immunoreactive in mice immunized with native 71-kDa-polylactide-coglyeolide (PLG); however, the reactivity was significantly lower than that of the native 71-kDa protein. Immunization of mice with a pooled fraction (upper fraction-71 kDa) of more immunoreactive peptides (consisting of P1 and P2) did not further boost their immunoreactivity. However, P1 and P2 exhibited comparable or even higher lymphocyte proliferation in human tuberculous and control subjects. These data suggest distinct antigenic specificities in humans and mice and further substantiate the use of the 71-kDa protein or its peptides P1 and P2 as potential vaccine candidates for tuberculosis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Immunoreactivity of peptides generated by limited proteolysis of 71-kDa cell wall protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra using PLG-microparticles.","doi":"10.1046/j.1472-765x.2000.00728.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1472-765x.2000.00728.x","venue":"Letters in applied microbiology"}

with dissociative and psychedelic potential has occurred worldwide over the last few decades. Psychedelic substances have historically been used in order to achieve altered states of consciousness such as dissociative states. We aimed here at describing both a large number of novel ketamine-like dissociatives and tryptamine/lysergamide/phenethylamine psychedelics available, whilst describing the acute/long-term clinical scenarios most commonly associated with their intake.Recent FindingsAn updated overview of the clinical and clinical pharmacological issues related to some of the most popular NPS categories has been provided, describing both psychosis and remaining psychopathological issues related to them.ConclusionsAlthough the complex link between NPS and psychiatric illnesses is yet to be fully understood, NPS misuse is now a significant clinical issue and an increasing challenge for clinicians working in both mental health and emergency departments.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/21437/03042019_final_accepted_paper_curr_add_reports_cs.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"New Psychoactive Substances (NPS), Psychedelic Experiences and Dissociation: Clinical and Clinical Pharmacological Issues","doi":"10.1007/s40429-019-00249-z","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-019-00249-z","venue":"Current Addiction Reports"}

It has been a great privilege to communicate with authors and reviewers in so many countries around the world. The greatest surprise has been how incredibly diverse the study of seizure disorders is today. I had always thought of myself as someone with a broad interest in my field. Now I know that my reading was actually quite selective. My work as an editor has been a real eyeopener in this respect. Since taking up my position, I have chosen one manuscript in each issue which stood out from the others and identified this as my Editor’s Choice. We have increased the visibility of these articles by making them available in full text from the date of publication on the Seizure website (http://www.seizure-journal.com). This look back at my selection over the last year does not only tell us something about Seizure but also about what the field has been up to in 2012. The Editor’s Choice for the first issue in 2012 was the report by Baulac et al. on the European Declaration. At present, the European Union produces a stream of negative publicity, often relating to ‘‘red tape’’ or the poor state of its members’ finances. This means that the good and useful work of EU institutions – such as the protection of human and consumer rights, the freedom of movement, or support for medical research – are easily overlooked. The Written Declaration on Epilepsy is a good thing which has come ‘‘from Europe’’ – that is, it can be a good thing if people with epilepsy, their families, carers and doctors as well as people interested in epilepsy research and healthcare policies, education and the provision of public services make it so. It provides a lever which can be used to negotiate improvements in epilepsy provisions and services as well as increases in funding for epilepsy research. In the second issue I chose the paper ‘‘Extended retention intervals can help to bridge the gap between subjective and objective memory impairment’’ by Witt et al. This study explored the large gap which exists between patients’ experience of their own memory performance and memory functions as they are measured in routine neuropsychological tests. Multivariate analyses identified memory performance after four weeks and self-rated mood as determinants of subjective memory impairment. Subjective memory appraisal therefore appears to reflect a different time scale from that captured in routine memory testing. The paper suggests that the introduction of longer retention intervals may enhance the ecological validity of clinical memory tests. The study also confirmed that it is important to consider the patient’s mood when dealing with subjective memory complaints.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1059131112003044","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059131112003044"],"title":"Looking back: Progress in epilepsy reflected in the Editor's Choice papers published in Seizure in 2012","doi":"10.1016/j.seizure.2012.11.015","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seizure.2012.11.015","venue":"Seizure"}

This hyperalgesia is extensively conceptualized to be a consequence of opioid receptor activity, perhaps providing an adaptive response to analgesia, and to utilize N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. These assumptions were tested here in opioid receptor triple knock-out (KO) mice lacking all three genes encoding opioid receptors (mu, delta, and kappa) by comparing their thermal nociceptive responses to the opioids morphine and oxymorphone with those of B6129F(1) controls. Injecting acute opioid bolus doses in controls caused maximal analgesia that was completely abolished in KO mice, confirming the functional consequence of the KO mouse opioid receptor deficiency. Continuous opioid infusion by osmotic pump in control mice also initially caused several consecutive days of analgesia that was shortly thereafter followed by several consecutive days of hyperalgesia. In contrast, continuously infusing KO mice with opioids caused no detectable analgesic response, but only immediate and steady declines in nociceptive thresholds culminating in several days of unremitting hyperalgesia. Finally, injecting the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 during opioid infusion markedly reversed hyperalgesia in control but not KO mice. These data demonstrate that sustained morphine and oxymorphone delivery causes hyperalgesia independently of prior or concurrent opioid or NMDA receptor activity or opioid analgesia, indicating the contribution of mechanisms outside of current conceptions, and are inconsistent with proposals of hyperalgesia as a causative factor of opioid analgesic tolerance.","inCitations":["1c3ef7872e304136226127dad68b10a4e41fc2de","0546cdfa61a8180000b803f58a56af4f0c84fc23","2a6625e58f282da94cf10628782cdc67658fea49","7f59505910ed72cfda7e14ab04eb395a3ac968c6","330c4f74b7b31c8ff2da9f4e128db8a5d267157d","0e1a59d82d170512032e0f36c413312a34ee693a","65e7865c85fe9d96d8fbe2a67f07108a859066eb","9c8154c558d22732a9b6eacfee706c2f09480cbc","fa79d39fea02adec5677e3b2f4f55ed130f5845b","d096f3432d04315b4f69d33c73eb855e7ad50e61","cd843b9bcfea0101ee30478c18daa7bb25f7f8ff","3b57fb325c970b8aaf5bd05856e4e52ff83d54b9","4bbb4c0d5c0d13e3e532aec2ce8a49dac5b234c8","30a7c8a5650fd9c4dcf92a2189dc9bc673ae8d85","90396c721b6f3043c37bd12f6d67cf8532f29587","7eb8a10695554f27c6b1f6fdca73faf4b32ce7b2","3628bd2432002eacc043fe8525dea6c43f6a9a8e","2d236aa1a886d82678737811f502cb25874b84a3","814a62e7b5791560ebcc46f9c30a3fdebf604b93","682758aa4efb0d258ad9efd76043fff75d843ec5","10d15af0655d24fdb7387a04b8cf5a7854eca8d4","3709cc767a66027ee373d5795d063ebcbde9cfab","45ae8253fb42bfaddc1a3e8c0b5acd65e60d32cd","d1a627516c41b903a94af20bcba97ab2fe09ceb4","c01df666ebc2437078d675c9261b9da6cf799619","8e0d1c45cf6bf99473bbec268c909de32f188578","29bf6a3a36d057dd1696673e81ecb808b8734c37","b2adb0f670949ca383bc7975996e586fbd012817","4d47bec57b66c32f7a0cade945e6d3bbc9a8371a","e847131301f7b15dd67e206fae27106323e2beb7","25d14c492659921d31eedbdf17f76f189e143266","6dda97bf4e4427fce56f0c86963c017629885d50","26630e3556e2b71a00ee935f1fcaee309320fd72","fab53c469c9dc926c2b8451c6975620bb12a7100","7374ea01ca21b0302d461862a2f313e64c27ee0a","2f3021ac57da566ef1c60d9d7776d84c26499949","f4bcbc1a288f526743b2389f7601edf7ccff26bb","5af5042ff5a7ebb6e85698114fa0f89656ee0dbd","16b4ff694ec331e85f36cd1d46ad907e5793fc3b"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306452207005374","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452207005374?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Nociception increases during opioid infusion in opioid receptor triple knock-out mice","doi":"10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.04.030","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.04.030","venue":"Neuroscience"}

For studies to be eligible for this SR, all had to evaluate single-implant restorations with a follow-up of at least 1 year after implant loading. A total of 19 prospective studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fifteen studies provided implant survival data (499 patient/509 implants), whereas 5 studies provided radiographic marginal bone height data (52 patients/52 implants). The analysis included studies with patients with single anterior or premolar, maxillary or mandibular edentulous sites bounded by anterior and posterior neighboring teeth. Meta-analyses of prospective trials (randomized-controlled trials, clinical trials, cohort studies, case series) reported loaded implant survival with one-year or more than one-year follow-up. Meta-analysis of prospective trials reporting marginal bone loss with one-year follow-up was also reported.\n\n\nKEY STUDY FACTOR\nThe key interventions were the timing of implant placement following extraction and the timing of implant loading after implant placement. Comparisons following greater than one-year follow-up were made between implants with immediate placement with immediate loading, immediate/early placement with conventional loading, conventional placement with immediate/early loading, or conventional placement with conventional loading.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nThe main outcome was implant survival. Radiographically determined peri-implant bone level change was also reported. Meta-analyses were completed using studies that reported one-year implant survival data (15 studies) and more than one-year implant survival data (11 studies). One-year marginal bone level data were analyzed for implants treated conventionally (5 studies). For survival and marginal bone levels, weighted rates and random effects models were used to calculate overall effects of the included studies. For greater than one-year follow-up, survival data were stratified by intervention type. Results were weighted for study size and stratified based upon timing of implant placement and loading. Esthetics, and patient satisfaction, and complications were reported, but heterogeneity of study design and reported outcomes excluded the results from meta-analysis.\n\n\nMAIN RESULT\nApproximately two-thirds of patients received implants in healed edentulous sites. Survival of single-tooth implants one year in function was 95.5% [95% CI: 93.0 -97.1]. Meta-analysis identified no difference in survival rate at one year when the results were weighted for study size and stratified based upon timing of implant placement and loading. Survival of single-tooth implants more than one year in function ranged from 92.4% [95% CI: 84.4 -96.4] for conventional placement with immediate loading to 97.5% [95% CI: 88.399.5] for immediate placement with immediate loading. The third meta-analysis identified 0.20-mm [95% CI: 0.034-0.36] marginal bone loss for implants one year in function. Qualitative interpretation of other esthetic, patient satisfaction, and complication outcomes revealed no difference in immediate, early, or conventional therapy approaches.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe authors concluded that implant-supported single-tooth replacement in the aesthetic zone with adjacent natural teeth can lead to short-term, favorable outcomes with regard to implant survival and marginal bone level change with early/immediate or conventional surgical placement and loading strategies.","inCitations":["bb8e5fad9a92fc3bfab2605892c1a4b490d5728e","2a7dbf5a30c51cce8bbe991eebf4d81f7df13431","1c2f97814e27388684674bb543e16e21852c1616","cef8d5b93cdbed792955d0a0e027f656daeeb564","8e2d1e27a0c0d3c5af84004ff9784e9e78f6dc7a","24a88a84a95f239e4c4a2b00be046202cf3dcc18","30b7dd6c929080c491822ee8a61d6a2a797af0c6","6ffa85f6bc0b2928cba357a97c90121684235a2b","ae217f75368f02a5fdd9aeb62adcc53b24174415","d12013b545971a59a1036c6eeb1f36dad25b5676","bf59c9cc9c6154a5de2116d39d29100073e12c7f","c3f723e1513a31656a0b69358085c50ba2d39d7d","59bb105f109c60b849b5d119abe4d2a02e7667d8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Early survival of single-tooth implants in the esthetic zone may be predictable despite timing of implant placement or loading.","doi":"10.1016/s1532-3382(12)70039-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s1532-3382%2812%2970039-8","venue":"The journal of evidence-based dental practice"}

Recently, the method has been extended to the overcomplete situation where the number of sources is greater than the number of receivers. Comparing complete ICA and overcomplete ICA in existing literature, one can notice that complete ICA does not assume noise in observations, and the sources can be explicitly solved from the receivers, whereas the overcomplete ICA in general assumes noise in observations and the sources are implicitly solved by gradient type algorithms. In this paper, we present an explicit nullspace representation for overcomplete ICA in the noiseless situation based on singular value decomposition (SVD), and develop an algorithm for estimating mixing matrix and recovering the sources. The null-space representation makes the connection between complete ICA and overcomplete ICA more apparent, and leads to a mathematical explanation of lateral inhibition in the context of overcomplete linear model.

An ordered structural phase formed by self-assembly of l-prolinate with (2,1;1,2) periodicity, and a transition from pure μ3 bonding to a mixture of μ3 and μ2 bonding with increasing exposure at 300 K, were observed. This behaviour has broad parallels with that previously seen with alaninate and glycinate on Cu{311}, but the detailed correlation between structure and bonding, and their evolution during subsequent annealing, are markedly different for prolinate as compared to alaninate and glycinate. At annealing temperatures around 480–490 K, a new structural phase with (5,3;4,6) periodicity emerges. We tentatively attribute this to pyrrole-2-carboxylate, formed by dehydrogenation and aromatization of the pyrrolidine ring of prolinate. The observation of equal areas of the two possible mirror domains associated with the two possible adsorbate–substrate bonding enantiomers implies a prochiral intermediate.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/248449/Madden%20et%20al%202015%20Topics%20in%20Catalysis.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Proline-Derived Structural Phases on Cu{311}","doi":"10.1007/s11244-015-0400-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11244-015-0400-2","venue":"Topics in Catalysis"}

Under conditions inappropriate for nitrogen fixation, NifL inhibits transcription activation by NifA through the formation of the NifL-NifA protein complex. NifL inhibits the ATPase activity of the central AAA+ domain of NifA required to drive open complex formation by sigma(54)-RNA polymerase and may also inhibit the activator-polymerase interaction. To analyze the mechanism of inhibition in greater detail, we isolated NifA mutants which are resistant to the inhibitory action of NifL. Mutations in both the amino-terminal GAF domain and the catalytic AAA+ domain of NifA were isolated. Several mutants blocked inhibition by NifL in response to both nitrogen and redox status, whereas some of the mutant NifA proteins were apparently able to discriminate between the forms of NifL present under different environmental conditions. One mutant protein, NifA-Y254N, was resistant to NifL under conditions of anaerobic nitrogen excess but was relatively sensitive to NifL under aerobic growth conditions. The properties of the purified mutant protein in vitro were consistent with the in vivo phenotype and indicate that NifA-Y254N is not responsive to the nitrogen signal conveyed by the interaction of NifL with A. vinelandii GlnK but is responsive to the oxidized form of NifL when ADP is present. Our observations suggest that different conformers of NifL may be generated in response to discrete signal transduction events and that both the GAF and AAA+ domains of NifA are involved in the response to NifL.","inCitations":["01386d4dcf1475c3999455100f242ba1b69a81c3","f29e918053ca9b13f4e16d5282d1ac699eb83241","c70f3964564cbe948a4832da52fa1ef0099ffe5c","4e0f0bcbb88e11f442434e30460fad8ebd9c0033","602886d9f8294fa497f1bdccfbf4a1f016ccf0d1","37a08a0025db8d61ebd66fdfae8c9feb5c22822c","95642ad66eb553a45e9953e29585adceed421263","cacc9991d9777bcd6c0e8d41120599139bcd69c2","e364b3f45c3edc41f2dc5f3885f19d5ebcf4f8d3","4b902be785106ffd7a0d942da0d6e582c7f387e0"],"pdfUrls":["http://jb.asm.org/content/184/24/6777.full.pdf"],"title":"Mutant forms of the Azotobacter vinelandii transcriptional activator NifA resistant to inhibition by the NifL regulatory protein.","doi":"10.1128/jb.184.24.6777-6785.2002","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.184.24.6777-6785.2002","venue":"Journal of bacteriology"}

A few factors were considered when I judged which one of the three techniques that was most suitable: The model's geometry, the workflow and the rendering (material and lightning).The three chairs were rendered in the same scene with the same lightning and settings. The results showed that the model's geometry and how smooth it is to work with the modeling technique matter most for judging which technique is the most appropriate.

This leads to an improved detection of multivessel disease and the possibility to assess not only the culprit lesion but lower grade stenoses as well. For appropriate revascularization, perfusion defects must be matched to coronary lesions. It has been shown that image fusion of morphological and functional images is superior to side-by-side analysis. Still, software for quantitative perfusion PET combined with CT angiography is rare. In this paper we present a new software tool for image fusion and visualization of quantitative perfusion PET and coronary morphology derived from CT angiography.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn our software, a PET uptake image is used for manual co-registration. Co-registration results are then applied to the functional data derived from compartment modelling. To evaluate the reproducibility of the manual co-registration, we calculated the deviation between a series of manual co-registrations performed on nine pairs of unregistered PET and CT datasets by five trained participants. Two dimensional transfer functions were used to highlight the coronary arteries from the CT study in the combined data sets.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe average Euclidian distances for three references points were between 3.7 and 4.1 mm. The maximum distance was 10.6 mm. By the use of the two dimensional transfer functions, coronary anatomy could be easily visualised either by user-interaction or automatically by use of neuronal networks.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWith this approach it is possible to combine quantitative perfusion PET with coronary anatomy derived from CT angiography. Our first experiences indicate that manual image fusion with our tool is reproducible and that visualisation of the combined datasets is achieved within short time.","inCitations":["80ee84231f618b48df6f2d6b1c9104725e49d33c","ccc7afac14fefb2ce8bacb7ee6855cbf3c8e148b","7832dfcfd49540e01378838188e1b5ca28b44b85","f610ea805cdf5ebda6537bdff509038c2a9546c2","20acb93cd3e90b7d73c8e7d49baddad0b83929dc","72aaf73dada63f2857f992ce561ede5624ce4e86"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Quantitative myocardial perfusion PET combined with coronary anatomy derived from CT angiography: validation of a new fusion and visualisation software.","doi":"10.1016/j.zemedi.2009.05.005","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zemedi.2009.05.005","venue":"Zeitschrift fur medizinische Physik"}

Baroness Neuberger reiterated the importance of appropriate use of medications to achieve a peaceful death. One concern was that a continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) was started when dying was diagnosed or the LCP commenced, regardless of symptoms. Aim To investigate the use of medications at the end of life. Method A retrospective audit of deaths within one hospital was undertaken in July 2013. Results Of 44 hospital deaths over a one-month period, 82% (n=36) were deemed expected. 56% (20/36 patients) were prescribed anticipatory medications for symptoms of pain, agitation, nausea, vomiting and secretions by the appropriate route and frequency. 100% of anticipatory PRN prescriptions were correctly dosed and 83% were appropriately prescribed parenterally. 72% of patients utilised anticipatory as required (PRN) medication. A CSCI was used in 42% (15/36) of cases. They most commonly contained an opioid to manage pain (93%) and/or a benzodiazepine for agitation (73%), but also included anti-emetic (20%) and anti-secretory drugs (13%). The rationale for CSCI commencement was clearly apparent in 7/15 cases; most commonly it was due to frequent use of PRN drugs (n=6) or as a switch from a regular oral opioid (n=1). A CSCI was used for a mean of 3.9 days. One limitation of these findings is the reliance on written documentation within the patients9 medical notes. Conclusion and Recommendations This audit demonstrated that the majority of patients do not receive medication via a CSCI at the end of life, but that most are administered PRN medication for their comfort. The rationale for starting a CSCI should be clearly documented, specifically recording indication for use and communication with patient, family and carers.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Drugs at the End of Life: an Appropriate Concern?","doi":"10.1136/bmjspcare-2014-000654.197","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2014-000654.197","venue":""}

Remediation of contaminated sediment at Randle Reef is currently underway and is expected to be completed by 2022. In order to measure the effectiveness of the remedial effort on the surrounding ecosystem as well as enable the project's success to be critically evaluated, short and long term site-specific monitoring studies are required. As such, research scientists and sediment remediation specialists have collaborated to develop a site-specific, comprehensive series of environmental monitoring plans. The monitoring plans use several metrics to determine the state of the ecosystem prior to, during and post remediation. Monitoring studies have been designed to measure physical, biological and chemical trends over time. These studies will be used to determine the overall effectiveness of the remediation project and ultimately lead to the eventual delisting of Hamilto...","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Environmental monitoring to guide and assess the effectiveness of Randle Reef sediment remediation on the recovery of Hamilton Harbour","doi":"10.1080/14634988.2017.1316658","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2017.1316658","venue":""}
