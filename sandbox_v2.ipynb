The type of research is descriptive, longitudinal and applied, with a quasi-experimental design, the methods were used: scientific and inductive-deductive, the study population was formed by the students of the second semester of the civil engineering career of the Faculty of Engineering of the National University of Chimborazo, the type of sampling was stratified probabilistic. The technique used for the collection of data was observation, with its instrument the observation sheet. For the verification of the hypothesis, the z statistic was used for independent samples. Finally, it was verified that the students who use the virtual laboratory do not have significantly different learning compared to those that use the traditional laboratory, therefore it is concluded that the use of the Virtual Laboratory against the use of the Traditional Laboratory does not significantly improve the learning of the Harmonic Movement Simple, of the students of Second semester of the Race of Civil Engineering of the National University of Chimborazo.\",\"inCitations\":[],\"pdfUrls\":[],\"title\":\"Análisis comparativo del uso del laboratorio virtual con el tradicional para el aprendizaje del movimiento armónico simple con los estudiantes de segundo semestre paralelos “a” y “b” de la carrera de Ingeniería Civil de la Universidad Nacionalde Chimborazo.\",\"doi\":\"\",\"sources\":[],\"doiUrl\":\"\",\"venue\":\"\"}\n",
